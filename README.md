Detecting Anomalies in Regional
Electricity Usage: Case Study of California and Texas

Description: This study examines electricity demand anomalies in two U.S. regions: ERCOT (Texas) and
CAISO (California) by applying three unsupervised machine learning models: Local Outlier
Factor (LOF), DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest. A total of nineteen engineered features, including temporal, meteorological, and rolling statistical indicators, were utilized to identify abnormal demand patterns from 2021 to 2024. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using
Optuna for DBSCAN, and SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the modelsâ€™ decision
mechanisms.
